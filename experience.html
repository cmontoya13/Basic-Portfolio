				<h3>Working Skills</h3>
				<p>My foremost goals when developing a website are user experience and search engine optimization. Making sure that all users are able to view and interact flawlessly with a website is a balancing act of many variables. I minimize restrictive scripts by coding as much as possible with HTML5 and CSS3. Where scripting is used, I always provide an alternative path for users who deny scripts. Onload speed is increased by decreasing server requests, moving scripts to the page bottom or setting them for asynchronous load. I use keyword optimization tools to find the best words and phrases to incorporate within the page title, headers and content without over saturating. Stickiness is achieved by utilizing insightful content, HTML5 effects like transitions and animations, interesting imagery, complimentary colors and JavaScipt functions. I hold several #1 positions in Google.</p>

				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>I have a degree in Web Design and consider myself to be highly skilled in HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. I'm experienced in mobile layout, responsive design and semantic coding and have a working knowledge of crucial SEO tools and techniques. My time in the Graphic and Web Design fields has rewarded me with advanced knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite. I've additionally obtained certificates in JSON, jQuery, NodeJS, bootstrap, SASS, AJAX, AngularJS, Python and more. I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Boot Camp program at UC Irvine - completion in 2017. Web Development is my passion that I enjoy growing with.</p>

				<h3>Work Ethics</h3>
				<p>I bring a well-balanced amount of professionalism and fun to the workplace. I'm consistently one of the top producers with the lowest error rates among my peers. I understand that my employer is paying me to work and not play so I don't text, use Facebook or surf the internet on their dime. In fact, if you were to search for me on the internet, you would find that I've steered clear of getting caught up in the world of social media. Yet I also like to make work a fun environment and was once presented with a Humor Award by my employer.</p>
